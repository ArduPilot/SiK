/// The HopeRF HM-TRP board conveniently provides pads for programming
/// the Si1000.  These are the four 2mm-spaced holes next to the LEDs,
/// near the edge of the board ('o' in this picture).

/// The SiLabs programmer has a 10-pin ribbon cable, for which you will
/// need to make an adapter.  The User Guide, linked from the page here:
///
///  http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBDebug.aspx
///
/// describes the pinout of the cable.
///
/// WARNING: The SiLabs adapter provides 5V on the USB Power pin.  DO NOT
/// connect this directly to the VDD_MCU pin on the HM-TRP module, or you
/// will (probably) destroy the chip.  If your HM-TRP board is mounted on
/// a breakout module that supports 5V input, you can connect USB Power
/// there.  If not, you must arrange for your own power supply, either by
/// adding a regulator to your cable or by using some other power source.
///
/// Connect the SiLabs debug adapter to the HM-TRP as follows:
///
/// Debug Adapter Pin:                 HM-TRP pin
///
///        2 <--------------------------> GND
///        4 <--------------------------> C2D
///        7 <--------------------------> C2CK
///       10 <-> 5V to 3.3V converter <-> VDD_MCU
///
///
/// @page hm_trp_hookup Connecting the HM-TRP Board
///
/// If you are making your own adapter board for the HM-TRP, note that
/// whilst the stock firmware requires the ENABLE pin be tied low,
/// it is a flow control input to the SiK radio firmware.
///
/// Also, the CONFIG pin is a flow control output, and a series resistor
/// of at least 33 ohms must be placed in series with it to avoid damage
/// to the Si1000 when it is jumpered low to force bootloader entry.
